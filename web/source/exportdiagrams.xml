   It is possible to export the content of the ontology as GraphML diagrams which can be opened in the <ref id="yEd" /> tool.

   The diagrams can be exported with the following content:
   <ul>
      <li>Export the complete ontology</li>
      <li>Export the content of one <ref id="packages" desc="package" /></li>
      <li>Export one or several classes selected in the <ref id="Model window#Class structure tab" desc="Classes tree" /> and the elements which are associated to this or these classes</li>
   </ul>

   <title title="export the complete ontology" />
   The File &rArr; "Export as GraphML" action export the complete Ontology as a GraphML file, which can be opened in the <ref id="yEd" /> tool.
   The File &rArr; "Open in yEd" action will directly open the yEd tool on the exported Ontology graph.

   For example:
   <img id="diagramexample" />

   <title level="2" title="export with packages" />
   It is possible to export the complete content of an ontology with <ref id="packages" />.

   For example suppose the following ontology:
   <img id="exportpackages" />

   The result of the export will be:
   <img id="exportpackages2" />

   After having opened the packages nodes, we will have:
   <img id="exportpackages3" />

   <title level="2" title="export  one or several classes" />
   If we select one or several classes selected in the <ref id="Model window#Class structure tab" desc="Classes tree" />, the export will show:
   <ul>
      <li>These highlighted classes</li>
      <li>The super-classes and the sub-classes of these classes</li>
      <li>The aliases of these classes</li>
      <li>The classes which are in the domain or the range of object properties associated with these classes</li>
      <li>The data properties of these classes</li>
      <li>The Individuals of these classes</li>
   </ul>

   For example, if we select <code>Class1</code> and <code>Class2</code> in the following ontology:
   <img id="exportselectclass" />

   We will have the following diagram:
   <img id="exportselectclass2" />
   
   <messageBox type="info">
      The "Maximum Class Radius" <ref id="configuration#Diagrams settings" desc="configuration property" /> allows to specify 
      the maximum distance in the graph of Classes included in the diagram relative to those selected in the export.
   </messageBox>
