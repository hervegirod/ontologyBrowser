   <meta desc="This article explains how the Foreign Elements are included in the model" />
   By default all foreign elements (that is elements which are not in the defaut namespace of the Ontology) are presented. However it is possible to:
   <ul>
      <li>Only show foreign elements if are associated with an element which is in the default namespace</li>
      <li>Show elements in the default namespace in bold and foreign elements in regular font in the tree</li>
   </ul> 
   
   <title title="configuration options" />
   The <ref id="configuration" desc="configuration options" /> which specify these options are:
   <ul>
      <li>General settings:
         <ul>
            <li>"Show Own Elements in Bold": checked if elements which are in the default namespace are presented in Bold in the tree</li> 
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Parsing settings:
         <ul>
            <li>"Include Foreign Disconnected Elements": checked if elements from namespaces different from the default namespace should not be included in the
               result by default</li> 
         </ul>
      </li>      
   </ul> 
   
   <title title="Example" />  
   Suppose the following ontology, importing the BFO ontology:
   <img id="ownelementsprotege" />
   
   With the default configuration, we have:
   <img id="ownelementsforeignall" />
   
   If we uncheck the "Include Foreign Disconnected Elements" property, we will have:
   <img id="ownelementsforeign" />
   
   If we check the "Show Own Elements in Bold" property, we will have:
   <img id="ownelementsbold" />   
   
   <see id="configuration" />
   <cat id="configuration" />
