   Two types of errors can appear when running a script:
   <ul>
      <li>The script can fail to compile</li>
      <li>The script can throw an exception during running</li>
   </ul>

   The first error will popup a Window allowing to show the error line, and navigate in the StackTrace of the error in the case of runtime errors.

   <title title="Compilation errors" />
   If the script fail to compile, the script execution will abort before actually starting.

   For example, for the following script:
   <pre syntax="java">
      void process(NamedElement element) {
      _  execute(element);
      }

      void execute(NamedElement element) {
      _  return 1;
      }
   </pre>

   You will have the following error:
   <img id="scripterrorcompile"/>
   Clicking on the error will highlight the line responsible for the error.

   <title title="Runtime errors" />
   If  script throws an exception during running the script execution may or may not abort depending on the "End Script at First Exception" checkbox:
   <ul>
      <li>If the checkbox if checked, then the script execution will abort</li>
      <li>If the checkbox if not checked, then the script execution will continue for the next Owl element. In that case, only the current <code>process</code> method will be stopped, and it will still
         try to continue its execution after this method</li>
   </ul>

   For example, for the following script:
   <pre syntax="java">
      void process(NamedElement element) {
      _  execute(element);
      }

      int execute(NamedElement element) {
      _  int a = 0;
      _  return 1/a;
      }
   </pre>

   You will have the following error:
   <img id="scripterrorruntime"/>

   Clicking on the error will highlight the line responsible for the error. You will also be able to navigate in the StackTrace.
