   The Tools &rArr; Debug Script action allows to debug a <ref id="Script" /> on the currently selected schema.

   <title title="overview" />
   The debugging does not use the <wikipedia path="Java Platform Debugger Architecture" />. It works by inserting "shadow"
   <code>step</code> instructions in the script source code before creating a debug session, allowing to execute the debugging session in the
   context of the calling program, and even if the scripting language does not support "standard" debugging.

   When the code execution steps through and instruction, the control flow is passed to the Debug session which will decide if:
   <ul>
      <li>The execution must <b>continue</b> through the next instruction</li>
      <li>The execution must pause at the <b>step</b>. The values of the variables at this step can be retrieved in the debug session</li>
   </ul>
   It is possible to set a <ref id="breakpoint" /> at any step line, in which case the execution flow will pause, if the
   breakpoint conditions are met.
