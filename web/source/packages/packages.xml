   This article presents the notion of Packages in the application.

   <title title="overview" />
   There is no notion of packages in Owl/RDF schemas. However it can be useful to group classes in Owl/RDF schemas as classes are grouped in packages in object-oriented
   languages.

   If the "Show Packages" property is selected in the <ref id="configuration#Packages settings" desc="configuration" />, the tool will by default show classes as packages providing that:
   <ul>
      <li>The Class has no properties (no Data properties nor object properties)</li>
      <li>The Class has at most one parent class (which is also a Package)</li>
      <li>The Class has at least one subclass</li>
   </ul>
   It is possible to override this behavior to disallow some classes to be seen as packages, or on the contrary to force one class to be seen as
   a package. See <ref id="Packages Configuration" /> for more information.

   If the "Show Packages" property is selected, the left part of the GUI will present two trees:
   <ul>
      <li>The graph of Owl classes</li>
      <li>The list of packages</li>
   </ul>
   For example:
   <img id="browserPackages" width="60%"/>

      <li>The Class has at most one parent class (which is also a Package)</li>
      <li>The Class has at least one subclass</li>
   </ul>

   a package. See <ref id="Packages Configuration" /> for more information.

   <title title="example" />
   Suppose the following Owl/RDF class diagram:
   <img id="openWithoutPackages"/>

   If the "Show Packages" property is selected, it will produce the following yEd diagram:
   <img id="openWithPackages"/>

   <see id="Packages Configuration" />
   <cat id="packages" />
