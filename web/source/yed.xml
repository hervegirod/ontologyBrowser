   <title title="apply a layout"/>
   The exported diagrams have to layout, you will need to use the layout features of yEd to obtain a readable diagram. For example, suppose the
   following Owl/RDF diagram:
   <img id="export1" width="60%" />

   The result of the export is the following, when opened with yEd:
   <img id="export2" width="60%" />

   You can apply the Hierarchical layout:
   <img id="exportHierarchicalLayout" />

   The result will be:
   <img id="exportResult" width="60%" />

   <title title="GraphML format"/>
   The yEd tool is compatible with the standardized GraphML format which is the graph output format of the Ontology browser tool.
