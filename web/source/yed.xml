   <meta desc="This article explains how to use the yed tool on exported Owl/RDL schemas" />
   The diagrams exported by the tool use the GraphML format, compatible with the <a href="https://www.yworks.com/products/yed">yEd</a> free editor.

   <title title="overview" />
   The yEd tool is a free diagram editor allowing to show, export and manipulate diagrams in the <a href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/">GraphML</a> format<note>To download the
      yEd tool, go to the <a href="https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download#download">www.yworks.com/products/yed/download</a> page</note>

   The export feature of the tool produce graphML files wich are compatible with the yEd tool.

   <messageBox type="warning">
      Note that the exported diagrams have no layout, you will need to use the layout features of yEd to obtain a readable diagram.
   </messageBox>

   <title title="apply a layout"/>
   The exported diagrams have no layout, you will need to use the layout features of yEd to obtain a readable diagram.
   
   <title level="2" title="apply a hierarchical layout on the diagram"/>
   The hierarchical layout in yEd will try to organize the nodes respecting the nodes hierarchy.

   For example, suppose the following Owl/RDF diagram:
   <img id="export1" width="60%" />

   The result of the export is the following, when opened with yEd:
   <img id="export2" width="60%" />
   
   If you apply a Hierarchical layout:
   <img id="exportHierarchicalLayout" />   

   The result will be:
   <img id="exportResultHierarchical" />
   
   <title level="2" title="configure the hierarchical layout"/>
   <moreInfo id="Diagrams export layout" />
   It is possible to configure the hierarchical layout to ensure that the Y relative position if nodes is kept if possible when applying the layout.
   
   To configure this layout, right-click on the "Hierarchical" option. The following panel will appear:
   <img id="exportHierarchicalLayout2" />  
   
   If you check the "Use Drawing As Sketch" checkbox, the tool will try to ensure that the Y relative position if nodes is kept if possible when applying the layout.
   
   <title level="2" title="apply a tree layout on the diagram"/>
   The tree layout in yEd will try to organize the nodes in a tree.

   If you apply a Tree layout on the same diagram:
   <img id="exportTreeLayout" />

   The result will be:
   <img id="exportResultTree" />   

   <title level="2" title="apply edges routing"/>
   It is possible to apply edges routing without moving the nodes, which can be useful if you moved node after applying a layout, and you only want
   to fix the edged paths.

   For example, suppose the following diagram, after we moved the <code>Class3</code> node:
   <img id="diagramafternodemove" />

   You can apply edges routing:
   <img id="edgerouting" />

   The result will be:
   <img id="diagramafternodemoveedgerouting" />

   <title title="GraphML format"/>
   The yEd tool is compatible with the standardized GraphML format which is the graph output format of the Ontology browser tool.
